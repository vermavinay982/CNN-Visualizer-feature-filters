# Weights-Visualizer-for-CNN
What a neural network captures? The filter and feature-maps can be visualized with any image to test with.


feauture maps closer to the input of model captures a lot of fine detail in the image as we progress deeper in the model, feature map show less detail this pattern was expected as the model abstracts the features from the image into more general concepts that can be used to make a classification still it is not clear from final image the model saw a bird, we generally lose the ability to interpret these deeper feature maps

## Final Feature Map - Closer to the Output - Fired Up Neurons - Not Clear if A bird

## Third Feature Map - A little Clear

## Second Feature Map - More Clear
